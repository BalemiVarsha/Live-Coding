# Live-Coding
Live coding is an innovative recruitment tool that provides a real-time platform for evaluating candidates' coding skills. Through a unique link, recruiters can observe candidates writing, editing, and executing code without traditional screen sharing.
Live coding assessments offer a streamlined and interactive evaluation process, enabling recruiters to make informed hiring decisions based on candidates' performance. At the end of the session, the code written by the candidate is saved for further review and assessment.
